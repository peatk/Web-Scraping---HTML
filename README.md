# Web-Scraping - HTML


### Background
In this web-scraping and data analysis project, I utilized my web scraping skills by identifying HTML elements, utilizing automated browsing with Splinter, and parsing HTML with Beautiful Soup. The focus is on strengthening core skills such as collecting, organizing, and analyzing data while effectively communicating insights visually.

In this web-scraping and data analysis project, there were two main deliverables. 

#### Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
The first deliverable involves scraping titles and preview text from the Mars News website using automated browsing and Beautiful Soup. The extracted information was stored in Python dictionaries with 'title' and 'preview' keys, organized into a list, and optionally exported to a JSON file for sharing. 


#### Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
The second deliverable focuses on scraping and analyzing Mars weather data from a specified site. This includes creating a Beautiful Soup object to extract data from an HTML table, assembling it into a Pandas DataFrame, and performing various analyses, such as determining:

##### The number of months on Mars

##### Finding the coldest and warmest months

##### Identifying months with the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure

##### Estimating terrestrial days in a Martian year

The final step is to export the DataFrame to a CSV file, providing a comprehensive and organized dataset for further use. Through these tasks, you will apply and enhance your web-scraping and data analysis skills.
